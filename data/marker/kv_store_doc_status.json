An estimated 45,000 tons of REO in mineral concentrates were produced and were valued at \\$260 million. Bastnaesite (or bastnäsite), a rare-earth fluorocarbonate mineral, was mined as a primary product at a mine in Mountain Pass, CA. Monazite, a phosphate mineral, was stockpiled as a separated concentrate or included as an accessory mineral in heavy-mineral-sand concentrates in the southeastern United States. Mixed rare-earth compounds also were produced in the Western United States. The estimated value of rare-earth compounds and metals imported by the United States in 2024 was \\$170 million, an 11% decrease from \\$186 million in 2023. The estimated leading domestic end use of rare earths was catalysts. Significant amounts of rare earths are imported as permanent magnets embedded in finished goods. Other end uses were ceramics and glass, metallurgical applications and alloys, and polishing.\n\n| Salient Statistics—United States:                              | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   | 2023   | 2024e  |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Production:e                                                   |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Mineral concentrates2                                          | 39,000 | 42,400 | 42,500 | 41,600 | 45,000 |\n| Compounds and metals3                                          | —      | 120    | 95     | 250    | 1,300  |\n| Imports:e, 4                                                   |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Compounds                                                      | 6,510  | 7,690  | 10,700 | 8,920  | 8,000  |\n| Metals:                                                        |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Ferrocerium, alloys                                            | 270    | 330    | 395    | 259    | 220    |\n| Rare-earth metals, scandium, and yttrium                       | 363    | 580    | 487    | 476    | 90     |\n| Exports:e, 4                                                   |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Ores and compounds                                             | 40,000 | 44,200 | 45,900 | 20,700 | 43,000 |\n| Metals:                                                        |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Ferrocerium, alloys                                            | 626    | 825    | 1,520  | 817    | 1,100  |\n| Rare-earth metals, scandium, and yttrium                       | 25     | 20     | 24     | 63     | 320    |\n| Consumption, apparent, compounds and metals5                   | 6,490  | 7,900  | 10,200 | 10,100 | 6,600  |\n| Price, average, dollars per kilogram:6                         |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Cerium oxide, 99.5% minimum                                    | 2      | 2      | 1      | 1      | 1      |\n| Dysprosium oxide, 99.5% minimum                                | 261    | 410    | 382    | 330    | 260    |\n| Europium oxide, 99.99% minimum                                 | 31     | 31     | 30     | 27     | 27     |\n| Lanthanum oxide, 99.5% minimum                                 | 2      | 2      | 1      | 1      | 1      |\n| Mischmetal, 65% cerium, 35% lanthanum                          | 5      | 6      | 7      | 5      | 5      |\n| Neodymium oxide, 99.5% minimum                                 | 49     | 98     | 134    | 78     | 56     |\n| Terbium oxide, 99.99% minimum                                  | 670    | 1,346  | 2,051  | 1,298  | 810    |\n| Employment, mine and mill, annual average, number              | 185    | 293    | 350    | 450    | 570    |\n| Net import reliance7 as a percentage of apparent consumption:8 |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Compounds and metals                                           | 100    | >95    | >95    | >95    | 80     |\n| Mineral concentrates                                           | E      | E      | E      | E      | E      |\n\n**Recycling:** Limited quantities of rare earths were recovered from batteries, permanent magnets, and fluorescent lamps.\n\n**Import Sources (2020–23):** Rare-earth compounds and metals: China, 9 70%; Malaysia, 13%; Japan, 6%; Estonia, 5%; and other, 6%.
