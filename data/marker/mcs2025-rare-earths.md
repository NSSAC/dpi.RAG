### **RARE EARTHS1**

[Data in metric tons, rare-earth-oxide (REO) equivalent, unless otherwise specified]

**Domestic Production and Use:** Rare earths were mined and processed domestically in 2024. An estimated 45,000 tons of REO in mineral concentrates were produced and were valued at \$260 million. Bastnaesite (or bastnäsite), a rare-earth fluorocarbonate mineral, was mined as a primary product at a mine in Mountain Pass, CA. Monazite, a phosphate mineral, was stockpiled as a separated concentrate or included as an accessory mineral in heavy-mineral-sand concentrates in the southeastern United States. Mixed rare-earth compounds also were produced in the Western United States. The estimated value of rare-earth compounds and metals imported by the United States in 2024 was \$170 million, an 11% decrease from \$186 million in 2023. The estimated leading domestic end use of rare earths was catalysts. Significant amounts of rare earths are imported as permanent magnets embedded in finished goods. Other end uses were ceramics and glass, metallurgical applications and alloys, and polishing.

**Events, Trends, and Issues:** Global mine production was estimated to have increased to 390,000 tons of REO equivalent largely owing to increased mining and processing in China, Nigeria, and Thailand.

**World Mine Production and Reserves:** Reserves for Russia, South Africa, the United States, and Vietnam were revised based on company and Government reports.

**World Resources: <sup>10</sup>** Rare earths are relatively abundant in the Earth's crust, but minable concentrations are less common than for most other mineral commodities. In North America, measured and indicated resources of rare earths were estimated to include 3.6 million tons in the United States and more than 14 million tons in Canada.

**Substitutes:** Substitutes are available for many applications but generally are less effective.
