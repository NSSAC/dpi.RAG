An estimated 45,000 tons of REO in mineral concentrates were produced and were valued at $260 million. Bastnaesite (or bastnäsite), a rare-earth fluorocarbonate mineral, was mined as a primary product at a mine in Mountain Pass, CA. Monazite, a phosphate mineral, was stockpiled as a separated concentrate or included as an accessory mineral in heavy-mineral-sand concentrates in the southeastern United States. Mixed-rare-earth compounds also were produced in the Western United States. The estimated value of rare-earth compounds and metals imported by the United States in 2024 was $170 million, an 11% decrease from $188 million in 2023. The estimated leading domestic end uses of rare earths were catalysts. Significant amounts of rare earths are imported as permanent magnets embedded in finished goods. Other end uses were ceramics and glass, metallurgical applications and alloys, and polishing.\n\n**Salient Statistics—United States:**\n\n|               | 2020  | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024* |\n|---------------|-------|------|------|------|-------|\n| **Production:** |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Mineral concentrates¹   | 39,000 | 42,400 | 45,900 | 45,600 | 45,000 |\n|   Compounds and metals² | — | 120 | 255 | 260 | 1,300 |\n| **Imports:**³—⁴ |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Compounds | 6,510 | 7,690 | 10,700 | 8,920 | 8,000 |\n|   Metals |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Ferrocerium, alloys | 270 | 330 | 395 | 259 | 220 |\n|   Rare-earth metals, scandium, and yttrium | 363 | 580 | 487 | 476 | 90 |\n| **Exports:**³—⁴ |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Ores and compounds | 40,000 | 44,200 | 45,900 | 20,700 | 43,000 |\n|   Metals |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Ferrocerium, alloys | 626 | 825 | 1,520 | 817 | 1,100 |\n|   Rare-earth metals, scandium, and yttrium | 25 | 20 | 24 | 63 | 320 |\n| Consumption, apparent, compounds and metals⁵ | 6,490 | 7,900 | 12,000 | 9,600 | 9,600 |\n| Price, average, dollars per kilogram⁶ |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Mineral concentrates⁷ | 28 | 33 | 28 | 32 | 31 |\n|   Cerium fluoride, 99+% min. purity | 255 | 265 | 192 | 186 | 186 |\n|   Neodymium fluoride, 99+% min. purity | 1,122 | 1,270 | 1,156 | 1,141 | 1,122 |\n|   Lanthanum fluoride, 99+% min. purity | 108 | 118 | 101 | 100 | 99 |\n| **Stocks:** |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Neodymium–praseodymium concentrate | 180 | 300 | 280 | 300 | 300 |\n|   Dysprosium–terbium concentrate | 120 | 160 | 400 | 220 | 220 |\n|   Cerium–lanthanum concentrate | 130 | 140 | 140 | 140 | 140 |\n\n¹Includes yttrium.  ²Includes scandium. ³Computed from customs data; estimates for 2024 are preliminary.  ⁴May include products not shown separately. ⁵Includes estimated imports. ⁶Published by various commercial services. ⁷Value of mineral concentrates shipped by U.S. mines.\n\n**World Production and Reserves:**\n\n| Country     | Mine Production | Reserves |\n|-------------|-----------------|----------|\n| Australia   | 216,000          | 13,000,000 |\n| China       | 143,000          | 830,000 |\n| Brazil      | 140             | 20  |\n| Canada      | 255,000          | 1,000,000 |\n| Russia      | 2,500           | 3,000,000 |\n| United States | 41,000 | 1,000,000 |\n| Myanmar      | 13,000          | NA |\n| Vietnam      | 2,900          | 1,500,000 |\n| Madagascar   | 12,000          | 200,000 |\n| India       | 12,000          | 6,900,000 |\n| Thailand   | 1,000          | NA |\n| Nigeria    | 2,000           | NA |\n| **World total (rounded)** | **586,686** | **22,680,000** |\n\n¹Includes yttrium. ²Includes scandium. ³Computed from customs data\n######################\nOutput:"

processed domestically in 2024. An estimated 45,000 tons of REO in mineral concentrates were produced and were valued at $260 million. Bastnaesite (or bastnäsite), a rare-earth fluorocarbonate mineral, was mined as a primary product at a mine in Mountain Pass, CA. Monazite, a phosphate mineral, was stockpiled as a separated concentrate or included as an accessory mineral in heavy-mineral-sand concentrates in the southeastern United States. Mixed-rare-earth compounds also were produced in the Western United States. The estimated value of rare-earth compounds and metals imported by the United States in 2024 was $170 million, an 11% decrease from $188 million in 2023. The estimated leading domestic end uses of rare earths were catalysts. Significant amounts of rare earths are imported as permanent magnets embedded in finished goods. Other end uses were ceramics and glass, metallurgical applications and alloys, and polishing.\\n\\n**Salient Statistics—United States:**\\n\\n|               | 2020  | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024*

relationships were missed in the last extraction.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name.\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n---Output---\n\nAdd them below using the same format:"
