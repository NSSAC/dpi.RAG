An estimated 45,000 tons of REO in mineral concentrates were produced and were valued at $260 million. Bastnaesite (or bastnäsite), a rare-earth fluorocarbonate mineral, was mined as a primary product at a mine in Mountain Pass, CA. Monazite, a phosphate mineral, was stockpiled as a separated concentrate or included as an accessory mineral in heavy-mineral-sand concentrates in the southeastern United States. Mixed-rare-earth compounds also were produced in the Western United States. The estimated value of rare-earth compounds and metals imported by the United States in 2024 was $170 million, an 11% decrease from $188 million in 2023. The estimated leading domestic end uses of rare earths were catalysts. Significant amounts of rare earths are imported as permanent magnets embedded in finished goods. Other end uses were ceramics and glass, metallurgical applications and alloys, and polishing.\n\n**Salient Statistics—United States:**\n\n|               | 2020  | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024* |\n|---------------|-------|------|------|------|-------|\n| **Production:** |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Mineral concentrates¹   | 39,000 | 42,400 | 45,900 | 45,600 | 45,000 |\n|   Compounds and metals² | — | 120 | 255 | 260 | 1,300 |\n| **Imports:**³—⁴ |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Compounds | 6,510 | 7,690 | 10,700 | 8,920 | 8,000 |\n|   Metals |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Ferrocerium, alloys | 270 | 330 | 395 | 259 | 220 |\n|   Rare-earth metals, scandium, and yttrium | 363 | 580 | 487 | 476 | 90 |\n| **Exports:**³—⁴ |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Ores and compounds | 40,000 | 44,200 | 45,900 | 20,700 | 43,000 |\n|   Metals |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Ferrocerium, alloys | 626 | 825 | 1,520 | 817 | 1,100 |\n|   Rare-earth metals, scandium, and yttrium | 25 | 20 | 24 | 63 | 320 |\n| Consumption, apparent, compounds and metals⁵ | 6,490 | 7,900 | 12,000 | 9,600 | 9,600 |\n| Price, average, dollars per kilogram⁶ |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Mineral concentrates⁷ | 28 | 33 | 28 | 32 | 31 |\n|   Cerium fluoride, 99+% min. purity | 255 | 265 | 192 | 186 | 186 |\n|   Neodymium fluoride, 99+% min. purity | 1,122 | 1,270 | 1,156 | 1,141 | 1,122 |\n|   Lanthanum fluoride, 99+% min. purity | 108 | 118 | 101 | 100 | 99 |\n| **Stocks:** |       |      |      |      |       |\n|   Neodymium–praseodymium concentrate | 180 | 300 | 280 | 300 | 300 |\n|   Dysprosium–terbium concentrate | 120 | 160 | 400 | 220 | 220 |\n|   Cerium–lanthanum concentrate | 130 | 140 | 140 | 140 | 140 |\n\n¹Includes yttrium.  ²Includes scandium. ³Computed from customs data; estimates for 2024 are preliminary.  ⁴May include products not shown separately. ⁵Includes estimated imports. ⁶Published by various commercial services. ⁷Value of mineral concentrates shipped by U.S. mines.\n\n**World Production and Reserves:**\n\n| Country     | Mine Production | Reserves |\n|-------------|-----------------|----------|\n| Australia   | 216,000          | 13,000,000 |\n| China       | 143,000          | 830,000 |\n| Brazil      | 140             | 20  |\n| Canada      | 255,000          | 1,000,000 |\n| Russia      | 2,500           | 3,000,000 |\n| United States | 41,000 | 1,000,000 |\n| Myanmar      | 13,000          | NA |\n| Vietnam      | 2,900          | 1,500,000 |\n| Madagascar   | 12,000          | 200,000 |\n| India       | 12,000          | 6,900,000 |\n| Thailand   | 1,000          | NA |\n| Nigeria    | 2,000           | NA |\n| **World total (rounded)** | **586,686** | **22,680,000** |\n\n¹Includes yttrium. ²Includes scandium. ³Computed from customs data",
