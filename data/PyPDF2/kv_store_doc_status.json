Cordier [(703) 648–7707, dcordier@usgs.gov]  RARE EARTHS1\n[Data in metric tons , rare-earth -oxide (REO) equivalent , unless otherwise specified] \nDomestic Production and Use : Rare earths were mined and processed domestically in 2024. An estimated \n45,000 tons of REO in mineral concentrates were produced and were valued at $260 million. Bastnaesite (or \nbastnäsite), a rare -earth fluorocarbonate mineral, was mined as a primary product at a mine in Mountain Pass, CA. \nMonazite, a phosphate mineral, was stockpil ed as a separated concentrate or included as an accessory mineral in \nheavy -mineral -sand concentrates  in the southeast ern United States . Mixed rare-earth compounds also were  \nproduced in the Western United States . The estimated value of rare- earth compounds and metals imported by the \nUnited States in 2024 was $ 170 million, a n 11% decrease from $186  million in 20 23. The estimated leading \ndomestic  end use of  rare earths was catalysts . Significant amount s of rare earth s are imported as permanent \nmagnets embedded in finished goods. Other end uses were ceramics and glass , metallurgical applications and alloys, \nand polishing . \nSalient Statistics —United States : 2020  2021  2022  2023  2024e \nProduction:e \nMineral concentrates2 39,000  42,400 42,500 41,600 45,000 \nCompounds and metals3 — 120 95 250 1,300 \nImports:e, 4 \nCompounds  6,510  7,690  10,700  8,920 8,000  \nMetals:  \nFerrocerium, alloys  270 330 395 259 220 \nRare -earth metals, scandium, and yttrium  363 580 487 476 90 \nExports:e, 4 \nOres and compounds  40,000  44,200 45,900 20,700 43,000  \nMetals:  \nFerrocerium, alloys  626 825 1,520 817 1,100  \nRare -earth metals, scandium, and yttrium  25 20 24 63 320 \nConsumption, apparent, compounds and metals5 6,490  7,900  10,200  10,100 6,600  \nPrice, average, dollars per kilogram:6 \nCerium oxide, 99.5% minimum  2 2 1 1 1 \nDysprosium oxide, 99.5% minimum  261 410 382 330 260 \nEuropium oxide, 99.99% minimum  31 31 30 27 27 \nLanthanum oxide, 99.5% minimum  2 2 1 1 1 \nMischmetal, 65% cerium, 35% lanthanum  5 6 7 5 5 \nNeodymium oxide, 99.5% minimum  49 98 134 78 56 \nTerbium oxide, 99.99% minimum  670 1,346  2,051  1,298 810 \nEmployment, mine and mill, annual average, number  185 293 350 450 570 \nNet import reliance7 as a percentage of apparent consumption:8 \nCompounds and metals  100 >95 >95 >95 80 \nMineral concentrates  E E E E E \nRecycling : Limited quantities of rare earths were recovered from batteries, permanent magnets, and fluorescent \nlamps.  \nImport Sources (2020 –23):  Rare -earth compounds and metals: China,9 70%; Malaysia, 13%; Japan, 6%; Estonia , \n5%; and other, 6%.
